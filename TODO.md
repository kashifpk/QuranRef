- [X] Surah and aya numbering as bootstrap badges
- [X] Separate word ayas component
- [X] Reuse word ayas component in words by count
- [X] Display words by count
- [X] Count selection should be a drop down with all possible counts
- [ ] Investigate why some word counts are different than actual occurrences
- [ ] Changing text type or translation while ayas by word component (used in by word and words by count pages) is present on the page causes all ayas by word components to load information instead of only the ones that are clicked.
- [ ] Fix surah info not loaded issue when a page other than the home page is loaded directly. Perhaps loading surah info on app.mounted() will work instead of loading it on home.mounted()
