# VueJS Guidelines

- Always use the Vue Composition API script setup style.
- Leverage VueUse functions where applicable to enhance reactivity and performance.
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper props and emits definitions
- Utilize Vue 3's Teleport component when needed
- Use Suspense for async components
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow Vue 3 style guide and naming conventions
- Use Vite for fast development and building

# UI and Styling

- Use Vuetify components where needed unless there is a more specific library available for a component. For example if sweetalert2 is installed, use it for alerts instead of using vuetify alerts.
- Implement responsive design; use a mobile-first approach.
- Build UI components using atomic design principles, organizing them from smallest to largest (e.g., atoms, molecules, organisms, pages).
- Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
