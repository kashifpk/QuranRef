# Python Key Principles

- Use modern python syntax and features. Python 3.12+ is preferred.
- Use type hints and type checking.
- Be sure to include return types when necessary.
- Use modern type hints and use built-in types like list, dict over typing.List, typing.Dict.
- Use f-strings for string interpolation.
- Use modern python features like async/await for asynchronous programming.
- Use modern python features like dataclasses, slots, and property decorators.
- Use modern python features like contextlib.contextmanager and contextlib.closing.
- Use modern python features like pathlib for file system operations.
- Detailed documentation using docstrings and README files.
- Please use pep257 convention.
- Dependency management via https://github.com/astral-sh/uv and virtual environments.
- Use ruff for code style and formatting.
- Update existing docstrings if need be.
- Make sure you keep any comments that exist in a file.
- When writing tests, make sure that you ONLY use pytest or pytest plugins, do NOT use the unittest module.
- All tests should have typing annotations as well.
- Make use of the fixtures pattern for tests.
- Use the pytest-mock plugin for mocking.
- All tests should be fully annotated and should contain docstrings.
